# ✈️ Flight Price Analysis – EDA Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of flight prices to understand the factors that affect airfare costs.  
The notebook uncovers insights on airlines, routes, durations, and seasonal variations influencing flight ticket prices.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis  

Key steps in EDA:  
- 🔹 **Data Cleaning** → Handling missing & inconsistent values  
- 🔹 **Feature Engineering** → Extracting day, month, and duration features  
- 🔹 **Univariate Analysis** → Price distribution, Airline-wise insights  
- 🔹 **Bivariate Analysis** → Price trends across routes & durations  
- 🔹 **Visualizations** → Using **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for plots  

📌 Example Visualizations:  
- 📈 Flight Price Distribution  
- 📊 Airline vs Average Price  
- 🌍 Source–Destination Price Variations  
- ⏳ Impact of Duration on Price
